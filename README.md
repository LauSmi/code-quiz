# Module 4 challenge: Code Quiz

# Description:

For this assignment I built a four question quiz about JavaScript. It has a landing page, a separate page for each question, a timer, a score keeper, a page to enter your score and a leaderborad page. I had the assistance of a YouTube tutorial by Brian Design, as well as my tutor, James Compagnoni.
